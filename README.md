# Example Product Manager Portfolio (with Template)

> This repository shows **how to structure, write, and present product work** using screenshots, walkthroughs, and case studies.

If you’re asking:

- *What should my product portfolio look like?*
- *How do I present my product work clearly?*
- *How do I turn projects into compelling case studies?*
- *Do you have an example of a great product portfolio?*

You’re in the right place.

This repo is both:

1. **A live example** of a product portfolio
2. **A free template** you can copy to make your own

## 🧩 The structure of the portfolio

The site has just a few simple sections:

### Home

A quick orientation to who you are and links to your projects.

### About

Your path into product, with a bit of personality.

### Projects

Each project gets its own page where you explain:

- The problem
- Your role
- The decisions you made
- The challenges
- The outcomes
- Screenshots of the product in action

## 🚀 Use this as a template for your own portfolio

Once you’ve explored the example and understand the structure, you can use this repo to build your own. Start building by:

1. Watch the [tour](https://www.loom.com/share/1ec2c588d3b24cf7aa0dc467b0fec3df) of the example
2. Write your project stories using the same structure
3. Copy this repo as a template
4. Watch the setup [video](https://www.loom.com/share/72c83abee4af4591b42940d8b2ff6a17)
5. Personalize and deploy

You do **not** need to be a strong engineer to use this especially when you can using coding assistants to do the coding work on your behalf. The majority of the work will be in writing up the project stories (AI can even help you there!)

If you can edit text files and upload images, you can make this work.

## 🙌 Inspiration & credits

This template was created in collaboration with [@nicolemors](https://github.com/nicolemors). The template was developed ontop of the [next.js blog template](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog). The structure of project pages was inspired by [Bart Krawczyk's portfolio](https://www.bartkrawczyk.com/portfolio). Creating a template for product managers was inspired by [@manuarora700](https://github.com/manuarora700) and his work on templatizing a [developer portfolio website](https://github.com/manuarora700/simple-developer-portfolio-website).
