## 🛠 Tech stack (for those who care)

Built on the Next.js blog template with Tailwind.

You do **not** need to be a strong engineer to use this especially when you can using coding assistants to do the coding work on your behalf. The majority of the work will be in writing up the project stories (AI can even help you there!)

If you can edit text files and upload images, you can make this work.
